# semantic-release-changelog

A semantic release plugin for generating changelogs

## Description

This plugin effectively wraps [@semantic-release/changelog](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog), and adds the option to only generate changelog on specifc branches.

## Installation

`npm i @flexperto/semantic-release-changelog`

## Usage

See [upstream](https://github.com/semantic-release/changelog). The configuration options are extend by the `branches` property, which needs to be a RegExp if defined. If defined, the changelog will only be generated, when semantic-release is executed on a branch that matches the RegExp. Eg. this configuration will only generate a changelog on master and develop branches
